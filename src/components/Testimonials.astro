He was very professional in mannerism and actions, kindly explaining to me each step of the way what was being done and was generous in sharing his knowledge on how to accomplish further setup goals such as bungeecord/waterfall/velocity setup once he was done with the process. Will confidently look to him for further support when needed in the future.</p>

		<p class="text-sm">They never gave up on me no matter how many issues were presented when configuring my plugin from hell... ProGamingDk was very forthright; quickly and efficiently resolving errors on the fly, they certainly know what they're doing. I definitely would recommend their services to anyone who needs the support while configuring plugins, etc. The input garnered from them was invaluable and in the end, helped me actually attain a working product. Thanks again, really appreciate it!</p>
