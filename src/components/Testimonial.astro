		<p class="mt-2 text-sm font-light">I highly recommend ProGamingDk. He was quick, he's reliable and he did everything I needed very well. He provides a great support after sale and he's willing to help me when I have a question or when I encounter a problem even if it's not related to his sale. It's not very costly, so everyone that need to make a professional/ambitious project, can easily afford his services. BIG vouch.</p>

		<p class="mt-2 text-sm font-light">Initially, I perceived this individual as potentially detrimental, but upon further reflection, I have come to realize that they possess an exceptionally forthright nature. Their honesty, although seemingly unconventional, is genuinely well-intentioned and devoid of any malicious intent. I want to give a special shoutout to <@132557589757165569>  and his team for the help they personally gave me in the DMs at no charge / CodeNode LLC.</p>

		<p class="mt-2 text-sm font-light">Helped me with setting up a Pterodactyl platform on a fresh Linux install for me yesterday night at a reasonable price. He was very professional in mannerism and actions, kindly explaining to me each step of the way what was being done and was generous in sharing his knowledge on how to accomplish further setup goals such as bungeecord/waterfall/velocity setup once he was done with the process. Will confidently look to him for further support when needed in the future. <br><br> Helped me resolve a catastrophic SQL database failure today from me screwing around multiple times trying to figure out how they work with plugins. Very good after sales support overall being able to consult for a variety of minor issues that crop up while learning how to use the panel.</p>

		<p class="mt-2 text-sm font-light">They never gave up on me no matter how many issues were presented when configuring my plugin from hell... ProGamingDk was very forthright; quickly and efficiently resolving errors on the fly, they certainly know what they're doing. I definitely would recommend their services to anyone who needs the support while configuring plugins, etc. The input garnered from them was invaluable and in the end, helped me actually attain a working product. Thanks again, really appreciate it!</p>

		<p class="mt-2 text-sm font-light">7/10 for ProGamingDk! He was easy to get along with, and we could negotiate the price with him very easily. Though it'd take him a while to get stuff done and he was mostly busy/didn't have time, which I'm sure I was just unlucky. Great service overall, I really recommend it.</p>
